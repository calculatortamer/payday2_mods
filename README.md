# block non channel 1 chat messages / beardlib spam

## (FOR NON-BEARDLIB USERS ONLY)

are you tired of seeing [INFO] [4] __________ : GNAP/BEO|1/{"glove_variation":"mes_couilles"}  in your logs ?

this mod blocks non channel 1 chat messages, regular chat only reads channel 1, beardlib uses channel 4 to spam your logs with useless "GNAP" shit

i once got someone who spammed """"anti crash tester"""" or something in channel 4 chat and it froze my game for a few sec so i made this mod
